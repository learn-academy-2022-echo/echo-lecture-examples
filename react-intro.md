# The React Dev exp
- Component Based 
- Scalable
- Reusable
- UI (User interaction) Focused

#### Scalability
- Think about how the app will grow
- Creating code that works under many conditions


#### Reusable
- Functions to create UI elements
  - Return to us objects that hold JSX
  - Objects can hold data and behavior


#### User Interface // Interaction 
- Virtual DOM
  - listens in on individual nodes in the DOM and refreshes the Virtual DOM then compares the changes
  - Node - HTML tags when looking at the code through the lens of the DOM (named after a tree, leaves, etc)
  - DOM - document object model, visual representation of your code

### React Components 
- Functions
  - return a value
    - Can only return ONE value
  - React functions return JSX
    - React Fragment for component organization <> </>
- JSX 
  - JavaScript XML - Combo of JavaScript and an extended set of HTML
- Component Call / Invocation <HelloReact />
  - looks like HTML self closing tags with Pascal Case
- 

#### Errors
- Always be able to see the UI you are working on
- keep the console open to look for Errors and Warnings
 - Errors are messages that another developer found or tried to find what broke your app
 - warnings are just a heads up that something might break
